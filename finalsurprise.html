  <h1>For Vivek 🫂 From Mantasha</h1>
  <div class="sub">ConstaCloud brought us together, but your heart kept me there.</div>

  <blockquote>“मेरे हमदम, मेरे सुकून की वजह”</blockquote>

  <div class="story">
    We were in different cities, working on the same project, you as the developer, me as the manager.<br>
    Tight deadlines, remote calls, and long evenings.<br><br>
    The job tested us, but your voice gave me a reason to smile.  
    What began as work became my refuge.  
    And it all started the moment I said for the very first time,<br>
    <strong>“Sir... aapki awaaz bahut acchi hai.”</strong>
  </div>

  <a class="btn" id="revealBtn" href="#">Reveal My Birthday Promise</a>

  <div id="reveal">
    Once I met you, then drifted away,<br>
    Not knowing my heart would find its way.<br>
    Maybe we paused so fate could align,<br>
    So this time, your heart could truly be mine.<br><br>

    You accepted me again, so gentle, so kind,<br>
    You healed the chaos I kept in my mind.<br>
    No storms, no noise, just calm and light,<br>
    You made my dark days softly bright.<br><br>

    Your smile feels like home, your touch feels new,<br>
    The world slows down when I’m with you.<br>
    It’s only been days, yet it feels so long,<br>
    Like my soul remembers where it belongs.<br><br>

    You’re the full stop that ended my pain,<br>
    The start of my story, my sunshine after rain.<br>
    Your small sweet efforts, your patient tone,<br>
    Taught me that love can finally feel like home.<br><br>

    I don’t know what tomorrow may bring,<br>
    But I know it’s you I want in everything.<br>
    To laugh, to dream, to heal, to stay,<br>
    You’re the peace I prayed for, every day.<br><br>

    So on your birthday, here’s my promise so true,<br>
    Every beat of my heart whispers you.<br>
    No poems, no words could ever define,<br>
    How lucky I am that you are mine.<br><br>

    <em>Happy Birthday, Vivek! from the girl who found her calm in your kindness,  
    and her forever in your heart.</em><br>
