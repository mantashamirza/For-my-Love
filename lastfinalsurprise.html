    <div class="story">
      We were in different cities, working on the same project, you as the developer, me as the manager.<br>
      Tight deadlines, remote calls, and long evenings.<br><br>
      The job tested us, but your voice gave me a reason to smile.  
      What began as work became my refuge.  
      And it all started the moment I said for the very first time,  
      <strong>“Sir... aapki awaaz bahut acchi hai.”</strong>

    <div id="reveal">
Once I met you, then drifted away,<br>
Not knowing my heart would find its way.<br>
Maybe we paused so fate could align,<br>
So this time, your heart could truly be mine.<br>
<br>
You accepted me again, so gentle, so kind,<br>
You healed the chaos I kept in my mind.<br>
No storms, no noise,  just calm and light,<br>
You made my dark days softly bright.<br>
<br>
Your smile feels like home, your touch feels new,<br>
The world slows down when I’m with you.<br>
It’s only been days, yet it feels so long,<br>
Like my soul remembers where it belongs.<br>
<br>
You’re the full stop that ended my pain,<br>
The start of my story, my sunshine after rain.<br>
Your small sweet efforts, your patient tone,<br>
Taught me that love can finally feel like home.<br>
<br>
I don’t know what tomorrow may bring,<br>
But I know it’s you I want in everything.<br>
To laugh, to dream, to heal, to stay<br>
You’re the peace I prayed for, every day.<br>
<br>
So on your birthday, here’s my promise so true,<br>
Every beat of my heart whispers you.<br>
No poems, no words could ever define,<br>
How lucky I am that you are mine.<br>
<br>
      <em>Happy Birthday, Vivek — from the girl who found her calm in your kindness, and her forever in your heart.</em><br>
